## Zsh/Bash configurations

### Zsh

Zsh has become the default shell for Mac and the shell that I use the most now. My configuration include:
- Code automatically generated by managers like `conda`, `sdkman` and `jenv`.
- Common aliases
- Color configurations for `ls` and `grep`
- Better globbing
- History configurations
- Left and right prompt
- An execution timer for commands
- Virtual machine shortcuts (Virtual Box)

## Vim configuratinos

I enabled some common options. I use Vim-Plug for plugin managements. Except for the configurations for all the plugins,
I also include code for:
- Periodically update plugins upon entering Vim
- Automically save and restore session when opening with no arguments

## Others

### Global Gitignore

The global gitignore configuration includes Mac system files that are usually irrelevant.

### Brewfile

Generated by `brew bundle dump`. It contains brew commands for installing useful packages.
