# Dotfiles

A backup of all my personal configurations and an installation script.

## Dotsync

> [!Warning]

To sync dotfiles on your machine to the repository, use `./dotsync`.

To install repository dot files to your machine, use `./dotsync -i`.

## Shell configurations

Zsh has become Mac's default shell and the one I use the most now.

My configuration includes:
- Code automatically generated by managers like `conda` and `jenv`.
- Common aliases
- Color configurations for `ls` and `grep`
- Better globing
- History configurations
- Left and right prompt
- An execution timer for commands

I also tried to make the Bash configuration look as much like Zsh as possible.

## Others

### Neovim
It enables some common QoL options and uses [lazy.nvim] to install several
useful plugins that improve the development experience.

### Global gitignore

The global gitignore configuration includes editor caches and operating system
files that are usually irrelevant.

### Brewfile

Brew installation commands generated by `brew bundle dump`. Run `brew bundle
install` to run them.
